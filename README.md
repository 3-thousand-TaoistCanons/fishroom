Message forwarding for multiple IM protocols

## Motivation
TUNA needs a chatroom, while each IM protocol/software has its own implementation for chatroom.

Unlike email and mailing list, instant messaging is fragmented and everybody has different preferred software.
As a result, TUNA as a group of people, was splitted into IRC users, wechat users, telegram users, XMPP users, etc.

To reunionify TUNA, we create this project to synchronize messages among each IM client, so that people can enjoying
big party again.
